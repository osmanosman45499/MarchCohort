            <img class="coding-image" src="about me pic.png">
            <p>My name is Osman Osman and im 22 years old. I developed a passion for coding around 2-3 years ago
                but never really knew the steps to take or could not find the neccessary courses to help me achieve my goals till 
                i fortunately stumbled across Pivot2Tech.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I have completed  BTEC Level 3 engineering studies during college however i never
                really felt the desire to further pursue it. I have worked a couple retail jobs including argos and tesco's and many other 
                jobs which are heavily customer services related allowing me to have an excellent understanding with customer needs and satisfaction.
            </p><br>
            <p>I aspire to secure a position within the tech sector, with the goal of continuous growth and advancement in my role, while continually enhancing my skill set.</p>
