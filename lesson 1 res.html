         <p>Put simply, Expected Goals (xG) is a metric designed to measure the probability of a shot resulting in a goal.</p>
         <p>An xG model uses historical information from thousands of shots with similar characteristics to estimate the likelihood of a goal on a scale between 0 and 1.</p> 

         <h3 class="Headers">Deeper dive in to XG</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> A shot with an xG value of 0.2 is one that we would generally expect to be converted twice in every 10 attempts.</li>
                <li> Expected Goals (xG) is a metric that's intended to measure the probability of a shot resulting in a goal</li>
                <li>xG is calculated using a serious deep dive into the past. To measure the likelihood of shots being converted into actual goals</li>
                <li>xG uses historical information from thousands of shots with similar characteristics to estimate how likely a goal is on a scale between 0 and 1. </li>

         <h4 class="Headers">Benefits of XG in Football</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>xG shows us the importance of shot quality by emphasising the low chance of scoring from disadvantaged positions.</li>
                <li>It allows coaches and their backroom staff to identify particularly good finishers.</li>
                <li>Expected Goals also highlights the fact that crosses aren't the most effective way of scoring.</li>
                <li>xG is also great for team analysis.</li>
                <li>Expected Goals can also be extremely useful for scouting purposes. </li>
