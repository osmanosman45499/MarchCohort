                <h3><br><br>Ingredient List. </h3>
            
        
                <main>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Flour</li>
                    <li>Milk</li>
                    <li>Vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>Caster sugar</li>
                    <li>eggs</li>
                    <li>unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>Overripe bananas 2</li>



                    </ul>
                    <h4><br><br>Cooking:</h4>
                    <p class="paragraph"> This will take an 1 hour and 10 minutes to cook to<i> perfection.</i></p>

                    <ol>

                    <li>   Preheat the oven to gas, 180°C,    
            
                    fan 160°C. Grease and line a 1KG loaf tin.</li>
            
                    <br><li>Sift the flour into a bowl, then add the milk, vanilla, sugar and eggs. Beat with an electric mixer for up to 1 minute, or until the ingredients are combined and lighter in colour. Pour in the melted butter, then add the mashed banana and beat for a further minute or until well combined.</li>

                    <br><li>Pour into the tin and bake in the oven for 1 hour 10 minutes. Test to see if it's cooked by inserting a skewer. If it comes out clean, then it's done. If not, give it a few more minutes and check again.</li>
                
                
                    <br><li>Once cooked, remove from the oven and allow to cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then tip out onto a wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely. If you prefer an iced cake, make up some cream cheese icing and drizzle over before serving.
                
                    </ol>
                </main>

                    <i><br><br>Tip: you can also serve this cake warm straight out of the oven with ice-cream as a pudding. Drizzle with honey or maple syrup for a little added sweetness.</i>
