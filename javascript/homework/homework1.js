//q1 using string concatentation add two different strings together and print this off 

console.log("Hello" + " World")

//q2 Using variables create a variable for a number, a string. Then print each of these variables.

var firstword = "Hello"
var secondword = "2"

console.log(firstword)
console.log(secondword)

//q3 Using string concatenation in javascript combine 3 different variables and prints it off. I.e variable for name age and date of birth will result in “my name is abdulkadir I am 24 years old and I was born in 1998”. (you cannot use name age and dob as your variables).

var name = "Osman"
var age = "22" 
var dob = "2001"

console.log("my name is" , name, "I am years", age , "old and i was born in" , dob)
